## Unit Test Coverage Report

Unit test coverage report is generated with coverage.py and is visible [here](https://viljamilatvala.github.io/2048-algorithms/documentation/coverage_report/index.html)

## Unit Testing Implementation

Unit tests are created with the standard library's unittest framework. Currently tests exist for the GameHandler -class and the MiniMaxPlayer -class. Not included in unit testing are User Interface in /src/app.py, browser controls in BrowserGame -class and UserInputPlayer -class which itself is used in manually testing BrowserGame and the UI.

Unit tests can be run from the project root by calling

```
>coverage run -m unittest discover
```

After running the test, a HTML report can be generated by caclling

```
>coverage html
```

## Manual Testing

UserInputPlayer -class was created to prompt and relay move commands from the user. This way we can verify that the game loop and browser controls work as expected.

This test can be replicated by running /src/app.py, selecting UserInputPlayer as the player, and entering the wished amount of games to play. After that the user will be prompted for next moves, and they can inspect if the game obeys those instructions, loops and opens/closes new games correctly.
