# Weekly progress report - Week 5

## What has been done this week?

This week I attempted to increase the search depth of the algorithm, as well as find better heuristic function for it

## How has the program progressed?

This week the program did not progress all that much. This was not due to lack of effort but more that the done work did not prove to be very meaningful.

## What did I learn during the week?

This week I focused a lot on performance of the program. I tracked the programs performance and decisions more closely than before. In hindsight this should have been done from the start to guide towards efficient program. I do feel that I reached better understanding on how to modify the program to be more performant. Doing the peer review was very insightful as it allowed to see how someone else has tackled similar questions as I've had.

## What has been causing issues/slowed down progress?

A lot of trial and error was done to try to optimize the algorithms speed and scoring. Many attempts proved to either make only tiny improvements while others actually slowed it down.

## What will be done next?

I will try to implement iterative deepening with simple transposition tables to speed up the algorithm.
