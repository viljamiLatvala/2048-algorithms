# Weekly progress report - Week 1

## What has been done this week?
This week was used to

-Select the topic for the course project and do preliminary research on what implementing it would include. I had checked the topic ideas list on course page beforehand but I really found the opening lecture to be helpful in deciding on a topic stroke a balance between interesting, challenging and attainable.

-Create a Git repository for the project, setting up documentation structure and other administratory stuff for the course.

-Writing up the definition document of the project.


## How has the program progressed?
Project was created and started to form its structure. To ensure easy visual testing of created AI algorithm, a class responsible for controlling a 2048 game in browser was created. In the coming weeks this will make testing the actual algorithm easier. Applications architecture started to shape itself with game class that controls a certain implementation of 2048 game, game handler class that provides information about game grids to the actual algorithm and relays players decisions to move, and a main app that handles running the app based. The algorithm will be implemented as a player class that will receive games state from game handlers and respond with its next move.

## What did I learn during the week?
Having mostly programmed ETL scripts contained in one or two files for the past few years, I re-familiarized myself with some basic practises of project structure. I also did preliminary research into implementing a minimax/expectimini algorithm.

## What has been causing issues/slowed down progress?
I am a returning student, so there has been some overhead to re-familiarize myself with some programs/services/tools but so far it has been very manageable. It has been some time since I completed Data Structures & Algorithms, so I expect to use some time to brush up on that knowledge during this course.

## What will be done next?
Testing framework and possible additional project management tools need to be decided. After this the project structure starts to be in shape to start creating an actual algorithm to play the game.
