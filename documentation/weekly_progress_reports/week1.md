# Weekly progress report - Week 1

## What has been done this week?
This week was used to

-Select the topic for the course project and do preliminary research on what implementing it would include. I had checked the topic ideas list on course page beforehand but I really found the opening lecture to be helpful in deciding on a topic stroke a balance between interesting, challenging and attainable.

-Create a Git repository for the project, setting up documentation structure and other administratory stuff for the course.

-Writing up the definition document of the project.


## How has the program progressed?

## What did I learn during the week?

## What has been causing issues/slowed down progress?
I am a returning student, so there has been some overhead to re-familiarize myself with some programs/services/tools but so far it has been very manageable. It has been some time since I completed Data Structures & Algorithms, so I expect to use some time to brush up on that knowledge during this course.

## What will be done next?

## Other feedback or questions to the course instructor
