# Weekly progress report - Week 6

## What has been done this week?

This week I did alot of refactoring on the project to have it in a more neat, structured shape. I simplified some of the functions in generating new states to be more performant and implemented iterative deepening. As as bit of a sidetrack I also created a simple module for drawing gametrees for moves to verify functionality of the algorithm.

## How has the program progressed?

The program has progressed quite well. I am happy with the shape of the project with the made changes the algorithm reaches reliably depths of 7-11 within reasonable time in comparison to previous 6.

## What did I learn during the week?

I learned about iterative deepening and simplifying code.

## What has been causing issues/slowed down progress?

Time spent refactoring does not neccessarily add new features but it does simplify and improve performance. Some tests became obsolete/broke due to these changes and need to be rewritten.

## What will be done next?

Documentation, testing, integration testing. Then possibly utilizing transposition tables more.
